                      Commuting for the beginner.

     In this hurly-burly world of Inter-City travel, there are few things
that warm a worker's heart more than the prospect of commuting.  It is a
safe bet to place that at some time during your working lives, you will all
have to commute (in fact, the mathematicians amongst you will have been
doing this already for some time).

     Commuting in its very simplest essence is a journey from home to work,
and back again.  This simple description, however, does not convey the full
joy that can be had from commuting.  A typical enjoyable commuting day (and
it can take a whole day just to commute) may begin as follows:

6.30am  Wake up.  Actually, this is totally wrong, because at that time,
you're not capable of waking up.  What a pity somebody didn't tell your
alarm clock this!  All that you are physically capable of doing is hitting
the snooze button.
