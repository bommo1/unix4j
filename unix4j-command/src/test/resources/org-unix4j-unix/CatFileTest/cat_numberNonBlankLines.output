    1  Although there is no requirement that you do so, it is considered good
    2  form to check with an editor before quoting the File in a published work
    3  or commercial product.  We may have additional information that would be
    4  helpful to you and can assist you in framing your quote to reflect
    5  not only the letter of the File but its spirit as well.

    6  All contributions and suggestions about this file sent to a volunteer
    7  editor are gratefully received and will be regarded, unless otherwise
    8  labelled, as freely given donations for possible use as part of this
    9  public-domain file.

   10  From time to time a snapshot of this file has been polished, edited,
   11  and formatted for commercial publication with the cooperation of the
   12  volunteer editors and the hacker community at large.  If you wish to
   13  have a bound paper copy of this file, you may find it convenient to
   14  purchase one of these.  They often contain additional material not
   15  found in on-line versions.  The two `authorized' editions so far are
   16  described in the Revision History section; there may be more in the
   17  future.
