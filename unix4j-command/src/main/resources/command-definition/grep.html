<p>
	The grep utility searches the input, selecting lines matching a pattern; 
	the types of patterns are controlled by the options specified.
<p>
	By default, an input line is selected if any pattern, treated as an entire
	regular expression matches any part of the line excluding the terminating
	newline character(s). By default, each selected input line is written to the
	output.
<p>
	Regular expression matching is based on text lines. Since newline 
	character(s) separate or terminate patterns, regular expressions cannot 
	contain newline character(s). Similarly, since patterns are matched against
	individual lines (excluding the terminating newline character(s)) of the 
	input, there is no way for a pattern to match newline character(s) found in
	the input.
<p>
	Regular expressions used in this command must be based on the 
	{@link java.util.regex.Pattern Java regular expression syntax}.
