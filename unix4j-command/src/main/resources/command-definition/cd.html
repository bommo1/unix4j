The cd utility changes the working directory of the current command execution. 
If no directory operand is given, the cd utility changes to the user home 
directory as defined by the execution context (usually the directory specified 
by the {@code "user.home"} system property).  
If the cd argument is a {@link java.io.File File} and it is a directory, the 
current working directory is changed to the given file (relative paths are not 
resolved with the current working directory). If a string argument is passed to 
the cd utility, it is treated as a file argument and relative paths are resolved 
on the basis of the (old) current working directory. Wildcards are possible if 
the first matching file represents a directory. If the specified file or path 
argument does not represent a valid directory, an exception is thrown.
