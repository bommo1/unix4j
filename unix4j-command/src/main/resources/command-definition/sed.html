	Sed is a stream editor. A stream editor is used to perform basic text
	transformations on an input stream (a file or input from a pipeline).
	While in some ways similar to an editor which permits scripted edits
	(such as ed), sed works by making only one pass over the input(s),
	and is consequently more efficient. But it is sed's ability to filter
	text in a pipeline which particularly distinguishes it from other
	types of editors.

	<b>Some examples:</b>
	<p>
	<pre>input day into sed("s/day/night/") This will output "night"</pre>
	<p>
	<pre>input "day and night" into sed("s/\\sand\\s/-to-/") This will output "day-to-night"</pre>
	(Note the use of \s whitespace character).
