		<method args="" usesStandardInput="true">
			Reads items from the standard input, delimited by blanks (which can 
			be protected with double or single quotes or a backslash) or 
			newlines, and provides variables for the items read from the 
			standard input. The command following after xargs is executed once 
			for every input line; the item variables are usually passed to the 
			invoked command as arguments.
		</method>
		<method args="args" usesStandardInput="true">
			Reads items from the standard input, delimited by blanks and 
			newlines or a specified delimiter, and provides variables for the
			items read from the standard input. The command following after

			depending on the input options); the item variables are usually 
			passed to the invoked command as arguments.
			
			Options can be specified by acronym (with a leading dash "-") or by 
			long name (with two leading dashes "--"). Operands other than the 
			default "--maxArgs" operand have to be prefixed with the operand 
			name.

	<options>
		<option name="delimiter0" acronym="z">
			Input items are terminated by a null character instead of by 
			whitespace, and the quotes and backslash are not special (every
			character is taken literally). Disables the end of file string,
			which is treated like any other argument. Useful when input items 
			might contain white space, quote marks, or backslashes. The find 
			--print0 option produces input suitable for this mode.
			
			(This option is ignored if an explicit delimiter operand is specified).
		</option>
		<option name="exactArgs" acronym="x">
			Terminate immediately if {@code maxArgs} is specified but the found
			number of variable items is less than {@code maxArgs}.		

			(This option is ignored if no {@code maxArgs} operand is specified).
		</option>
 		<option name="noRunIfEmpty" acronym="r">
 			If the standard input does not contain any nonblanks, do not run the
 			command. Normally, the command is run once even if there is no 
 			input.
 		</option>
		<option name="verbose" acronym="t">
			Print the command line on the standard error output before executing
			it.
