	 * @param <R>
	 *            the generic return type for all command signature methods
	 *            to support different implementor types; the methods of a 
	 *            command factory for instance returns a command instance; 
	 *            command builders can also implement this interface, but their
	 *            methods return the builder itself enabling for chained method
	 *            invocation to create joined commands
